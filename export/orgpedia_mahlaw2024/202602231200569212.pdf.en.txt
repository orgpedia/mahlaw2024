Circular:
The Hon'ble Supreme Court vide Judgment dated 24/03/2025 passed in Civil Appeal
No. 4311 of 2025 (Yerikala Sunkalamma and Anr Vs. State of A.P. and Ors) has expressed
serious concern over the declining efficacy of notices under Section 80 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (CPC), observing that such notices have been reduced to mere formalities
Due to the different attitude of the government and public authorities. The Hon'ble Court
emphasized that a Section 80 notice is a valuable statutory opportunity for the State to examine
the merits of a claim and resolve genuine grievances without compelling citizens to undergo
avoidable litigation, and warned that failure to acknowledge or respond to such notices would
invite adverse inference against the Government. Criticizing the lackadaisical approach of
Public authorities, the Hon'ble Court held that ignoring statutory notices weakens the State's
Defense and unnecessarily drags litigants into protracted legal proceedings. The Hon'ble Court
extensively examined the scheme, object, rationale, and essential legal requirements of Section
80 CPC in paragraphs 93 to 114 of the judgment, and ultimately directed the Registry to
circulate the judgment to all High Courts and Chief Secretaries of State Governments, with
particular emphasis on strict compliance with the provisions relating to Section 80 of the CPC.
2. In the above context, all the administrative departments are informed that, the required
institutional mechanism and procedure is already in place, in the form of Rule 32 of the Rules
for the Conduct of Legal Affairs of the Government, 1984. The said provision contemplates
the procedure for dealing with the notices received by the Government under Section 80 of the
CPC. Rule 32 is reproduced herein below for ready reference:
32. Procedure for defence of suits on behalf of State or its officers-
(1) Notice of suit.-Where a notice of a suit against the State, under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 15 received by the Secretary to Government or the Collector concerned, he shall forward the same within 7 days to the officer principally concerned with or conversant with the matter in respect of which the suit 1s threatened. He shall also send within 7 days one copy of notice to the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs or the Joint Secretary or the Deputy Secretary to Government, Law and Judiciary Department at Nagpur or Aurangabad, as the case may be, and another copy to Government in the administrative department concerned. If any Government officer receives such notice of threatened suit against him in respect of any act done or purporting to be done by him in his official capacity, he shall also act in the same manner as stated above.
(2) Action to be taken when the threatened suit is indefensible.- (a) The Government officer to whom the notice 1s forwarded or served as stated in sub- rule (1) shall examine the claim made in the notice and ascertain the facts with reference to the relevant documents;

(b) where the statements made in the notice are vague, he shall endeavour to obtain, within 7 days, if possible in writing, a clear statement of the grievance of the person who served such notice;
(c) where upon a consideration of the relevant circumstances it appears to such Government officer that the act or conduct complained of by the notice- giver 15 wholly indefensible, he shall, within three weeks from the receipt of such notice, take action to redress the grievance or make a report to the proper authority to obtain such redress and take such other action in that behalf as may be required;
(d) where it is doubtful whether or not, the act or conduct complained of is justifiable, and the doubt arises as to the real intention of Government in the administrative department or such authority in any order, the carrying out of which has occasioned the service of notice, he shall, within 7 days from the receipt of notice, refer the matter for orders to Government in the administrative department or such authority;
(e) where the doubt is as to the legality of the act or conduct complained of, though it may have been done in pursuance of a rule or order issued by Government in the administrative department or the superior authority, the administrative department concerned shall send clear statement of the case, within 7 days, to the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs or the Joint Secretary or the Deputy Secretary to Government, Law and Judiciary Department at Nagpur or Aurangabad, as the case may be, for advice who in turn shall send his legal opinion to the administrative department concerned;
(f) if as a result of the references under clauses (d) and (e), the Government officer concerned finds that the act or conduct complained of is indefensible he shall forthwith proceed to redress the grievance;
(g) every endeavour shall be made by the Government officer concerned to have the matter disposed of within the statutory period of two months, from the delivery of notice, allowed by the Code of Civil Procedure before the threatened suit can be instituted. If it is not possible to redress the grievance of the notice-giver within a period of two months, due to some administrative difficulties, the Government officer concerned shall inform the notice-giver to wait for some time more after the expiry of the period of two months. The intimation, that the grievance of the notice-giver has been redressed, shall be given by the Government officer concerned to his head/administrative department concerned and also to the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs or the Joint Secretary or the Deputy Secretary to Government, Law and Judiciary Department at Nagpur or Aurangabad, as the case may be;
(h) if any kind of lapses on the part of any Government officer concerned in dealing with the notice results in the prolonged litigation and avoidable loss to Government, the administrative department concerned should take a serious view of such lapses.
(3) Action to be taken where the threatened suit is defensible. -
(a) If the Government officer concerned, to whom a notice of suit against the State is forwarded, is of the opinion that the suit 1s defensible, or any Government officer, who 15 served with a notice of suit in respect of an act done or purporting

to be undertake the defence of suit, shall collect, with the least practicable delay, all information regarding the facts of the case which he can procure;
(b) such officer shall forward, within three weeks from the receipt of notice, his parawise comments and other information together with copies of all the necessary documents to the administrative department concerned and inform it of the grounds on which it 15 proposed to defend the threatened suit. A copy of the grounds for defence of such suit shall also be sent to the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs or the Joint Secretary or the Deputy Secretary to Government, Law and Judiciary Department at Nagpur or Aurangabad, as the case may be;
(c) The Government officer concerned should also give a suitable reply, in consultation with the Government pleader concerned, to the notice-giver before the suit is actually filed. Such action may sometimes result in avoiding unnecessary litigation. "
